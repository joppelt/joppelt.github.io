summary: Why I Write
categories: Introduction

I started this blog as a way for me to process new ideas and information. I have been reading and discovering interests during this past year. The interest that precipitated my desire to write about what I was learning was rudimentary philosophy. Before finishing the first chapter I felt my mind focusing as if I were trying to thred a needle. However, I also felt that I wasn't allowing myself to fully appreciate these new ideas. I needed to spend more time before moving on. This is where I want to the blog to help me. I plan on only writing about ideas and information that standout to me. In each post I'll briefly explain the idea, then spend time thinking about it. Why is it interesting? Why is it important? How can it be applied? Where do I see it in my life? And so on. I don't know what I'll read or learn, but I plan to spend time learning about - philosophy, american history, political science, social theory, anthroplogy, and linguistics. This list is changeable and will change based on where my mind guides me.
